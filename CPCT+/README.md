# Instructions to run CPCT+ and Panic

1. run `source build.sh` to create nimbleparse
2. run `python parser_experiment.py -h` to know more
3. To evaluate PANIC, run `python parser_experiment.py src_path -n 500 -m PANIC`. (Change `src_path` to the path on your own machine)
4. To evaluate CPCT+, run `python parser_experiment.py src_path -n 500 -m CPCT_PLUS`. (Change `src_path` to the path on your own machine)

(You can change 500 to the number of files you want to evaluate.)
